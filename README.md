🚗 Uber Data Analytics | Modern Data Engineering GCP Project
This project demonstrates a modern data engineering pipeline built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Uber ride data. It showcases ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization of large-scale data following best practices in cloud-native data architecture.

📊 Project Overview
Objective:
To build an end-to-end data engineering solution that enables analytics on Uber ride data, leveraging GCP services to ensure scalability, automation, and performance.

Key Deliverables:

Data ingestion from external sources (e.g., Uber CSV data)

ETL pipeline with data quality checks

Data lake and warehouse integration

Dashboard for visual insights
